        <h2>INTERNET TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <h4>Internet</h4>
         <p>The term of internet is Inter Connected Network of Networks.The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate, share information, and access services across the globe. It connects devices through a common set of rules called protocols, enabling activities such as browsing websites, sending emails, streaming videos, and online learning. The Internet has become an essential part of daily life, making it possible to stay informed, connect with others, and access vast amounts of knowledge instantly.</p>
        <h5>The history of internet</h5>
         <p>Vaccum tubs magnatic techologies are used before. to insert data they wanna move near to the machines that were more heats and wanna wear the uniform for protect from heat.The history of the Internet began in the late 1960s with a project called ARPANET, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to allow computers to share information securely. At first, it connected only a few universities and research centers, but over time it grew and improved. In the 1980s, the invention of networking protocols like TCP/IP made it possible for different computer systems to connect easily. The World Wide Web, introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, made the Internet accessible to the general public through websites and browsers. Since then, the Internet has expanded rapidly and become a vital part of communication, education, business, and everyday life.</p>
        <h4>World Wide Web</h4>
         <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked documents and resources on the Internet that can be accessed through web browsers. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, who introduced the idea of using hyperlinks to connect information. The first website went live in 1991, marking the beginning of a new way to share and access knowledge. Unlike the Internet, which is the global network of computers, the Web is a service that runs on top of it, making information easy to navigate through web pages, links, and addresses (URLs). Today, the World Wide Web is an essential part of daily life, used for learning, communication, business, and entertainment.</p>
        <h4>Protocols</h4>
         <ul>IP - Internet Protocol</ul>
         <ul>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</ul>
         <h5>Internet Protocol</h5>
          <p>Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules that assigns unique addresses to devices and ensures data reaches the correct destination on the Internet.</p>
         <h5>Transmission Control Protocol</h5>
          <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) works with IP to break data into packets, send them reliably, and reassemble them in order at the destination.</p>
